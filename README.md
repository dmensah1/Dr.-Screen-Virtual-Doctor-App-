## Who We Are

We are a group of university students from Dalhousie University, Western University and University of Toronto. 
 
## Inspiration

The COVID-19 pandemic has vastly changed the way we approached our day-to-day tasks. Doctors are no exception. Due to lockdowns and various restrictions, they have been forced to move to a virtual environment. Furthermore, in Nova Scotia, where our team members are from, it was particularly difficult to schedule appointments due to longer than anticipated turn-around times. This led to non-urgent inquiries being pushed back and at times forgotten.

Dr. Screen was built as a supplementary tool to streamline family practitioners' jobs. Its goal is to reduce the amount of time that a practitioner would need to spend with patients for less serious inquiries such as diagnosis of patient conditions as well as prescription renewals. By streamlining simpler inquiries that require visits to the doctor, a doctor is able to help a greater number of patients throughout a day.
